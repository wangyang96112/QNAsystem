1,"ost of the food we eat is turned into glucose, or sugar, for our bodies to use for energy. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use its own insulin as well as it should. This causes sugars to build up in the blood. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations. Diabetes is predicted by a clear set of symptoms, but it still often goes undiagnosed. The main 3 diabetes signs are: Increased thirst, Increased need to urinate, Increased hunger, Diabetes is becoming increasingly more common throughout the world, due to increased obesity - which can lead to metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes leading to higher incidences of type 2 diabetes.",[],"['ost', 'food', 'glucose', 'sugar', 'energy', 'bodies']","['ost', 'food', 'glucose', 'sugar', 'bodies', 'energy']","ost of the food we eat is turned into glucose, or sugar, for our bodies to use for energy.",informationanddefinition,458,[],['Diabetes'],['Diabetes'],What is Diabetes?,,
